**Formula**:

```sql
Payment Conversion = (
  COUNT(orders WHERE payment_status = 'paid') /
  COUNT(total_orders)
) * 100

**Formula**:

```sql
Return Rate = (
  COUNT(orders WHERE status = 'returned') /
  COUNT(total_orders)
) * 100

Return Amount = SUM(orders.total_amount WHERE status = 'returned')
Return Units = SUM(order_items.quantity WHERE orders.status = 'returned')
```
